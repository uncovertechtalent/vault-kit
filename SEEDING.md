# Seeding: growing your vault from your own inputs

The `/seed` skill automates this. This is the manual version with the reasoning, so you can run it by hand or audit what the skill generated.

## The conventions (what the starter enforces)

1. **One idea per file ("atom").** The unit of retrieval is the unit of thought. If a file needs a table of contents, it is several atoms wearing a trenchcoat. Split it.
2. **Frontmatter, minimal.** `tags` and `created` cover most needs. Tags are hierarchical paths (`project/homelab`, `person/anna`) so searches can scope by prefix. Skip fields you won't query.
3. **Links are the graph.** `[[Other Atom]]` wherever a real connection exists. A link that doesn't resolve yet is a note to your future self, not an error.
4. **MOCs (maps of content) are grown, not planned.** When a cluster of atoms reaches critical mass (rule of thumb: seven), write an index note that links and one-line-summarizes them. Never create the MOC first.
5. **`_inbox/` is the only unsorted place.** Everything enters there; a periodic pass (you or the agent) atomizes and files it. An inbox that only grows means the atomize pass isn't running, and the vault is becoming a pile.
6. **Filenames are titles.** `Consequence Budgeting.md`, not `note-2026-08-03-a.md`. The filename is what links autocomplete against and what search results show. Rename when the idea sharpens; link-following tools handle renames, and stale names cost more than renames do.
7. **The agent writes atoms too.** Anything the model derives that took real work (a debugging conclusion, a decision and its why, a mapped subsystem) gets an atom, so next session starts from the conclusion instead of re-deriving it. This is the difference between a notes folder and a memory.

## The seeding interview (what /seed asks and why)

1. **What do you actually work on?** Names the 3-6 top-level domains. Not aspirational ones: things with activity in the last month.
2. **What do you keep re-explaining to the model?** Those are the first atoms, and the highest-value ones. Every re-explanation is a cache miss the vault exists to fix.
3. **What do you look up more than twice a week?** Reference material worth atomizing now rather than on demand.
4. **What's private?** Draw the boundary explicitly. A vault folder the search index skips (the starter's CLAUDE.md shows the pattern) beats discovering later that everything was indexed.
5. **Where does raw material arrive from?** (chats, meetings, browser, email) Determines what the inbox pass has to handle, and whether atomize needs source-specific handling.

From the answers, the skill creates ONLY: the domain folders that had real activity, `_inbox/`, one starter MOC per domain with the re-explained facts as its first atoms, and a CLAUDE.md that names the conventions, the private boundary, and the inbox-pass rule.

## What NOT to build on day one

- No tag taxonomy beyond what the first atoms need. Taxonomies built in advance describe the person you planned to be.
- No templates for atom types. Atoms converge on shapes through use; freeze the shapes after they emerge, not before.
- No automation (watchers, scheduled reindex, sync). Add each when its absence hurts twice. The kit's watch mode exists for when you get there.
- No migration of your entire existing notes pile. Atomize on touch: when something old becomes relevant, atomize it then. Bulk migration front-loads weeks of sorting into the moment your motivation is highest and your judgment about what matters is worst.

## Growing pains and their fixes

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Inbox growing, never shrinking | Schedule the atomize pass as a recurring session task; it is agent work, not owner work. |
| Search returns your huge old documents above your atoms | Atomize the documents that keep winning, or exclude the archive folder from indexing. |
| Two atoms about the same thing under different names | Merge, keep the better filename. The duplicate was a naming-convention drift signal, not a filing error. |
| Folders that stay empty | Delete them. They were someone else's head shape (possibly your own from a month ago). |
| Agent ignores the conventions | The conventions live in CLAUDE.md, not in your memory of having explained them once. If it drifts, the file was too vague; tighten the rule with an example. |
